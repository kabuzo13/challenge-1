# Code Refactor Challenge (Week 1)

## Description

It was necessary to refactor the HTML and CSS for this website to ensure that it would function perfectly as an informative website. This included correcting links to make sure they function, consolidating the CSS so it is easier to read for future developers, and adding 'alt' attributes to images to improve the accessibility and thus the SEO of the website.
